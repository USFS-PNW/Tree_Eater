# Tree Eater
Tree Eater is one module in Neoprocessor, a set of Python scripts created by Joshua Petitmermet (joshuapetitmermet@gmail.com). The files in this repository are intended to support Tree Eater as a standalone script to calculate an average value per cubic foot for each tree size-species group bin that can be manually entered into the FIA BioSum Processor Wood Values screen.
